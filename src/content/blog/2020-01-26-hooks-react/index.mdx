## 1. What are Hooks?

Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. **It does not work inside classes.**

Don't worry though, **classes aren't being removed or discouraged**. React's Developers being given more ways to code!

## 2. What's wrong with classes?


The React Hooks intro gives a good section on this: [Check Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#its-hard-to-reuse-stateful-logic-between-components).    
There are couple of problem with Classes  

>### It‚Äôs hard to reuse stateful logic between components.

React doesn‚Äôt offer a way to ‚Äúattach‚Äù reusable behavior to a component. With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. 
**Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.** This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.
>###  Classes confuse both people and machines
 
The gist is classes can sometimes be confusing and can be written any number of ways. Dive into somebody else's project and you could be in for a world of different syntax and style choices.
 By allowing classes to be converted into smaller functional components, we can even further break out parts of our application into **smaller and more focused components**.

<a name="reactstate"></a>  

## 3. React's State Hooks
Hook state is the new way of declaring a state in React app. Hook uses `useState() ` functional component for setting and retrieving state.

Let's say we have a component like this:

Let's say we have a component like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
This component will count the click on button.

With React Hooks, we are able to condense that class into this functional component:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how much easier the functional component would be for beginners just learning React.

## 4. What is this useState() syntax

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"  
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
**What does calling `useState` do?**
 It declares a ‚Äústate variable‚Äù. Our variable is called `count` but we could call it anything else, like `state`.
 
 **What do we pass to `useState` as an argument?** 
 The only argument to the `useState()` Hook is the initial state. In Classes the state should be Object, but in Hooks it does not need to be Object. We can keep a number or a string if that‚Äôs all we need. In our example,`0` is the initial state.
### What Do Square Brackets Mean?

You might have noticed the square brackets when we declare a state variable:

```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
This JavaScript syntax is called [‚Äúarray destructuring‚Äù](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Array_destructuring). It means that we‚Äôre making two new variables `count` and `setCount`, where `count` is set to the first value returned by `useState`, and `setCount` is the second.

## 5. What does useState() give us?
`useState` gives us two variables and we can name our two variables whatever we want. Just know that:

1.  The first variable is the **value**. Similar to `this.state`
2.  The second variable is a **function to update** that value. Similar to `this.setState`

The final part to useState is the argument that we pass to it. **The useState argument is the initial state value.** In the case of our counter, we started at 0.

## 6. Using Multiple State Hooks
We can even use `useState()` multiple times in the same function.
```javascript
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
```

## 7. React's Effect Hook

The _Effect Hook_ lets you perform side effects in function components. It does not use components lifecycle methods which are available in class components. In other words, Effects Hooks are equivalent to `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()` and `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle methods.


Side-effects are things you want your application to make like:

-   Fetching data
-   Manually changing the DOM (document title)
-   Setting up a subscription


>Effects will run after every render, including the first render.

Let's compare a class to a functional component:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Example extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('this is componentDidMount!');
    document.title = 'changeTitle';
  }

  render() {
    return <div>stuff goes here</div>;
  }
}
```

When using the the Effect Hook, we use `useEffect()`:

```javascript
function Example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('this is useEffect ');
    document.title = 'changeTitle';
  });

  return <div>stuff goes here</div>;
}
```

## 8. Running an Effect Hook only when something changes
Since `useEffect()` runs every time a component renders, how do we get it to only run once, on mount? The Effect Hook can **take a second argument**, an array. It will look through the array and **only run the effect if one of those values has changed**.

#### componentDidMount: Runs once

```javascript
// only run on mount. pass an empty array
useEffect(() => {
  // only runs once
}, []);
```

#### componentDidUpdate: Runs on changes

```javascript
// only run if count changes
useEffect(
  () => {
    // run here if count changes
  },
  [count]
);
```  

Now, you have some understanding of hooks and how they work. If you want to learn hooks in-depth, you should check the official docs by React's Developers.
